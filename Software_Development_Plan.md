## Statement of Purpose ##
Cat-nip is a Terminal App to help rehome rescue cats in the Brisbane area. 

It connects all the nearby shelters to run the ultimate 'Pop-Up' cat rehoming booth!

**Problem to Solve:**

There are sadly many unwanted cats and amzingly several shelters and independent cat foster carers but there isn't a database connecting all the shelters to maximise the chance of adoption. The easier it is to discover the available cats in need, the better chance of rehoming.

This app will allow an operator in a pop up adoption centre to facilitate people to adopt a cat or drop off a cat for adoption. This will 

**Target Audience:**

Adoption shelters and independent cat foster care providers would be able to work together and streamline processes of cat adoption to maximise possibility of finding forever homes.



## Features ##

1. Search for a new purring fur baby by
    - location of the local shelters
    - desirable features for your kitty (for example, colour - ginger)
2. Apply to adopt your chosen bundle of joy
    - form created for your customer and sent to the shelter for approval
3. A stray cat can be added to the database and notifiction sent to a shelter that has room to look after cat where it will live until someone is ready to adopt the kitty baby


All these features make this 'Pop-Up' cat rehoming booth easy for the chief cat adoption officer to facilitate cat and kitten rehoming in the easiest way possible.

## Project Management ##

Trello board created with specific user stories to plan and prioritise tasks. The Kanban method was utilised on the Trello board with cards - containing checklists to complete.
This ensured the project remained on track and progress or lack of progress over specific time periods could be 

Stand up meetings were held twice. In future, especially when working in teams on separate branches, this method will be utilised more effectively.
