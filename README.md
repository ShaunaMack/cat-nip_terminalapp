Cat-nip is a Terminal App to help re-home rescue cats in the Brisbane area. 

It connects all the nearby shelters to run the ultimate 'Pop-Up' cat re-homing booth!

**Features of the application**

1. Search for a new purring fur baby by
    - location of the local shelters
    - desirable features of a kitty (for example, colour - ginger)
2. Apply to adopt a chosen bundle of joy
    - form created for your customer and can be sent to the shelter for approval
3. A stray cat can be added to the database and notification can be sent to a shelter to look after cat where it will live until someone is ready to adopt the kitty baby.
4. As cats are adopted successfully, they can be removed from the system.


This 'Pop-Up' cat re-homing booth system makes it easy for the Chief Cat Adoption Officer to facilitate cat and kitten re-homing.
